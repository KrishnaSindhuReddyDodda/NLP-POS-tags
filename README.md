This project is about **generation of POS tags on pre-tokenized sentences using Stanza tool and evaluated them**.
For this we need to install python, NLTK and Stanza in our system. In this we are evaluating the performance in terms of accuracy using gold standard universal pos-tags as annotated in thr brown corpus, for this get pre-tokenized sentences and gold-standard pos tags from brown corpus for a genre using NLTK. After that convert universal-pos-tags from stanza to pos-tags of brown corpus and now evaluate the accuracy of pos tagging.
**About uploaded files**
In **Task1** Choose three genres from Brown corpus. For each genre, obtain pretokenized sentences and obtain their universal-pos-tags using Stanza. Evaluate the performance in terms of accuracy using the gold-standard universal pos-tags as annotated in the Brown Corpus.
In **Task2** Come up with at least five interesting sentences on your own in which one or more POS tags are not trival to tag. Obtain POS tags from Stanza.
In **a1,a2,accu files**, we imported some functions in all those files for easy evaluation for task1 and task2.
